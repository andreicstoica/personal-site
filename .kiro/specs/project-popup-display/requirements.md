# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the ExperienceTable component to display engineering projects in interactive popup windows instead of simple markdown links. The system will allow users to click on project names to view detailed information including descriptions, technologies used, links, and media in a modal overlay, providing a richer and more engaging way to showcase personal projects and work.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor viewing the experience table, I want to click on project names to see detailed information in a popup, so that I can learn more about specific projects without navigating away from the main page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a project name THEN the system SHALL display a modal popup with project details
2. WHEN the popup is displayed THEN the system SHALL show project title, description, technologies used, and relevant links
3. WHEN the popup is open THEN the system SHALL dim the background content to focus attention on the modal
4. WHEN a user clicks outside the modal or presses the escape key THEN the system SHALL close the popup

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to define project data in a structured format, so that I can easily manage and update project information separately from the experience descriptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining project data THEN the system SHALL support a structured data format with fields for title, description, technologies, links, and media
2. WHEN projects are associated with experiences THEN the system SHALL allow multiple projects per experience
3. WHEN project data is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect changes in the popup display without requiring code changes
4. WHEN no projects are defined for an experience THEN the system SHALL display the original description format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visitor using the site on mobile devices, I want the project popups to be responsive and accessible, so that I can view project details comfortably on any screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the popup SHALL adapt to smaller screen sizes with appropriate sizing and spacing
2. WHEN the popup is displayed THEN the system SHALL be accessible via keyboard navigation
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN the popup SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and focus management
4. WHEN the popup opens THEN the system SHALL trap focus within the modal for accessibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see visual indicators that projects are clickable, so that I can easily identify interactive elements in the experience descriptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN project names are displayed in experience descriptions THEN the system SHALL style them as clickable elements with hover effects
2. WHEN hovering over project names THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating interactivity
3. WHEN projects are embedded in text THEN the system SHALL maintain readable formatting while clearly distinguishing clickable elements
4. WHEN no JavaScript is available THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to show basic project information inline

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the popup system to integrate seamlessly with the existing ExperienceTable component, so that the current functionality and styling remain intact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the popup system is implemented THEN the existing experience table layout SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN experiences without projects are displayed THEN the system SHALL render descriptions exactly as before
3. WHEN the popup system is active THEN the existing filtering and responsive behavior SHALL continue to work
4. WHEN projects are displayed THEN the system SHALL follow the existing design system colors, typography, and spacing
