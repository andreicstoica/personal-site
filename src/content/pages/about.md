# Outside of work

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring NYC's art exhibits, cooking, running and playing tennis, reading way too many Substacks, and making coffee for my friends. <br><br>

Recently, I've been thinking about:

- [Do people like slop?](https://blog.andrei.bio/p/do-people-like-slop)
- [Why I quit my job to build the future I want](https://blog.andrei.bio/p/why-im-quitting-my-job)
- I grew up with multiple people over 100 years old, giving me a different perception of time than most kids! Wrote about that in [Lessons on Living](https://blog.andrei.bio/p/lessons-on-living). <br><br>

# Micropages

- [Canon](/canon) - People, books, films, and other media that have majorly shaped my thinking
- [Colophon](/colophon) - Details about this site
- [Fitness](/fitness) - Logging some fun re: sports and the outdoors
- I picked all of my classes in undergrad and even named my degree, wrote about that in my thesis defense: [Proposing a New Ethics for Human-Computer Interaction](https://blog.andrei.bio/p/proposing-a-new-ethics-for-human).
