## Current Focus

I'm passionate about building software that makes a difference. My work spans from web applications to mobile apps, with a particular interest in user experience and performance. I [wrote](https://blog.andrei.bio/i/166487078/career-or-what-i-could-see-myself-spending-years-pursuing) about what I could easily spend 20+ years pursuing and contributing towards.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the cooking, running and playing tennis, reading way too many Substacks, or exploring NYC.
